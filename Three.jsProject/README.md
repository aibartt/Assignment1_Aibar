## Project Concept & Idea
My idea was to create a Planet Explorer Website, where users can explore different planets in our Solar System. I implemented a 3D animation of 8 planets in solar sytem using Three.js client-side library. I borrowed the Three_Cube Project that we have seen in class and modified it. The website has two buttons Pause and Planet toggle, as the names suggest pause will pause the rotation of the planet and you could look in detail for the planet and Planet toggle button will display randomly selected planet in solar system.
