##Critique of Paper Planes

Today I am writing a critique about the Paper Planes connected application from
Experiments with Google. In this application, you can create your own plane from paper with
your location stamp and then fold it with simple actions on your smartphone. After that, you
can virtually throw your paper plane into the world, where it can be found by other random
people worldwide. I believe that the idea of bringing people together from all over the world
is fantastic, and the creators of the Paper Planes project did a great job in terms of
implementation, using the power of the web and Android to create an instant connection.
Also, physical actions like "Drag the corner / Tap the screen to throw the plane" give the
effect of reality. Then you can use your smartphone like a net to catch a plane. Overall I
would like to say that creators successfully achieved their goal of throwing a paper plane
from one screen to another. Unfortunately, the application is not supported in computers; I
believe that modern computers allow you to conveniently manipulate the mouse to get the
same level of interaction. Another disadvantage of this application is that the connection
between people is too superficial; that is, people put standard stamps on their location, and
the element of the individuality of each person disappears. I would add additional information
about the person, for example, about their name and how old they are, as well as, if desired,
the opportunity to leave wishes to another person. Thus, people will know that this plane was
made by a real person who has his own life and experiences, which in my opinion, will
significantly improve the emotional component of connecting these people. People will be
able to share their desires and experiences instead of just knowing the data about where this
person is from. In principle, the technical component of this project is very well done, and
with the help of the minor additions I wrote above, this project can be significantly improved.
