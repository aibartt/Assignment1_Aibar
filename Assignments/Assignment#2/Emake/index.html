        <p>Emake is an innovative tile that is made of a flexible waterproof material obtained by recycling 
            used car tires, which gives the tile strength and makes it resistant to abrasion. 
            The tile body is made of special stainless steel. When pressed, the upper face bends 
            by 5 millimeters, and forces the integrated converter to generate electricity. E-make is an alternative variant of UK based Pavegen project localized to Kazakhstan's Market. It is 3 times cheaper and uses fully recycled materials.</p>

            <h2>How it works?</h2>
        <p>Electricity can be stored in a lithium battery, or sent directly to power the lighting of advertising signs, storefronts, bus stops, etc. The original idea was to power the lanterns and signs on the streets of cities from the energy of people's footsteps.</p>
