## What I learned from this Assignment?

With the help of this project, I learned a lot about web development, HTML, and CSS. In practice, I used head, body, p, h1, h2, a, and img tags. With the development of this project, I realized how to link your CSS file to your HTML file. And also that after creating wireframes, implementation is easier and more organized. I learned CSS properties like -color, font size, background color, flex, justify-content, etc. With the help of the game, I realized that the flex layout allows the creation of flexible elements on a webpage. So I tried to implement some simple flex in my website. I made some progress in effectively using the GitHub platform; I learned how to get my webpages working link using GitHub functionalities. Overall I believe that I made significant progress in understanding what a simple web development process looks like and how we can use different elements of HTML and CSS to improve the user experience.
