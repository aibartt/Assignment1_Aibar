## What I learned from this Assignment?

With the help of this project, I learned a lot about web development, HTML, and CSS. I used head, body, p, h1, h2, a, img tags in practice. With the development of this project, I realized how  to link your css file in your html file. And also that after creating wireframes, implementation of them is easier and more organized.
