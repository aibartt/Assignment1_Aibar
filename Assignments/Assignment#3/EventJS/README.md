## What I learned from this Assignment?

With the help of this project, I learned a lot about Media queries - how can we make our website responsive. In practice, I used addEventListener() method for adding event handlers in web pages. The <button> element has an event called 'click' that fires when the user clicks the button. Objects that can fire events have an addEventListener() method. In my website I created image and text carousel of places to visit in Abu Dhabi using Even Arrays Images and Text. I did some progress on learning basics of JavaScript language, how to declare and initialize our variables, lists and etc. I also learned some Document Object Model (DOM) concepts and logic of accessing different parts of the website.
  
  I used one button element to create two event-driven user interactions that are handled in a script.js file. When the user clicks on the Explore Button, it depicts one of the tourist destinations in Abu Dhabi with a concise description, and when you click the button, it shows the following tourist destinations with its corresponding description.
